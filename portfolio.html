    <h1>1.1.1 Blown to Bits Reflection</h1>
    
    <p>I believe that computers will transform society. Eventually many people will have all of their information on the computer. 
    Having this information on the computer can be very useful but also very dangerous. People would be able to access this information
    because it's on the computer. Social media is another way people are using the computers. There are posting information about their
    self and other and anyone will be able to access it. Having this information on the internet isn't safe no matter what you do to try 
    to protect it. Having information on the internet can be very useful at times but can also be very dangerous since anyone can see it. 
    But keeping information on paper can nice but also hard when you have too many papers to keep track of.</p>
    
    <h1>1.1.2 Lightbot Reflection</h1>
    
    <c><img src="images/lightbot.png" height="480"></c>
    
    <p>The lightbot game works very similar to a computer. In the game you had different keys that made the object do things. We had 
    to arrange the keys so that the object would do them in a certain order. So when using a keyboard and clicking a key it has an 
    output to then show of on the computer. This is similar to the game. Also when searching something on the internet it would then 
    pull up a website. Lightbot is different from a computer because all the game is showing is that an object can turn and move any 
    direction. A computer has way more codes and loops then the Lightbot game.</p>
    
    <h1>1.1.3 Scratch Branching</h1>

    <p>1. This is important because in case you mess up on a part of the code it would be easier to find the mistake in a 
    small part of code than a big section of code.</p> 
    <p>2. Making code is like having a schedule for the day it has everything you want to do on it and it follows a certain order.</p>  
    <p>3. It was nice working with a partner because it was a lot easier to not make a mistake. We could both be thinking
    of ideas while one person is working.</p> 
    <p>4. Whenever a page is open it will only be running that page. You could have twenty pages open but only be actually
    running one or two of them.</p> 
    
    <h1>1.1.4 Scratch Objects and Methods</h1>
    
    <header3>
    <c><iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="//scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/177946166/?autostart=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></c>

    <p>1. If more than one sprite out of hundreds made the same noise when one key was pressed it would be very hard to tell what 
    sprite is making a noise. It could also get very annoying with all of the sounds.</p>
    <p>2. Events are when a certain key is pressed it makes something happen and Handlers are when  a series of events happen
    when one button is pressed.</p>
    <p>a)The play G button is an action that happens when a sirtin key is pressed.</p>
    <p>b) It would be convenient to have the play G button allow more than one event to occur at the same time.</p> 
    
    <h1>1.1.5 Scratch “Accumulator” and “Aggregator”</h1>

    <header3>
    <c><iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="//scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/173644098/?autostart=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></c>
    </header3>

    <p>1.   The primary advantage of using a fixed value variable is that it can be easily change.</p>
    <p>2.   If you were entering a transaction and wanted to know the effectiveness than you can use a most recent
    variable to compare.</p>
    <p>3.   a)  Video games use an accumulator to keep track how many points you have earned. Also,  an online calculator
    uses the accumulator to add, subtract, divide, etc and gives you an answer.</p>  
    <p>b) In a video game, every time a certain goal is accomplished the score is changed. The computer keeps track of these 
    score changes and with the accumulator function gathers the total score.</p>
    <p>4.   The accumulator only holds on to one number while the aggregator holds on to a whole list.</p>
    
    <h1>1.1.6 Scratch One-Way Flag</h1>
    
    <header3>
    <c><iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="//scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/174282013/?autostart=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></c>

    <p>1. The Stepper counts down a list.
          The Walker displays the number on the list being selected by the Stepper.
          The Best-So-Far determines the highest number out of the numbers it's given. Used for a high score keeper.</p>
    <p>2. It would be great for almost any game where score matters. Maybe a platformer in which time is a factor. You 
          would be able to play multiple times and the game would track your fastest time.</p>
         
    <h1>1.1.7 Pac-Man</h1>
         
    <video controls>
    <c><iframe src="file/pac man.mp4" type="video/mp4"></iframe></c>
    </video>
         
    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/174861686/#editor">Pac-Man Link</a>
         
    <p>For our game my team made maze where one of the pieces had to make it to the end before a different piece would catch up
    to it and kill it. The piece you control is pac-man and the piece that is trying to kill you is a ghost. The main piece is
    coded so it can go through the color black and the maze is the color black. The ghost is coded to follow pac-man but its not
    coded so it cannot pass through the color black so it makes the game a bit more difficult. When you make it to the finish line
    a new page will come up saying “YOU WIN”.</p>
  
    <h1>1.2.2 Introducing App Inventor</h1>
    
    <p>1. App inventor is similar to Scratch because it uses the same block and drag system to program. You can’t see the costumes 
    and where they are on the screen. It is shown in the sprites menu.</p>
    
    <p>2. There will be a greater amount of people working on these apps for a mobile device. This will  increase the amount of 
    app available  and the consumer base for app creation and editing software.</p>
  
    <h1>1.2.3 Creating Mobile Apps</h1>
    
    <p>1. Both scratch and app inventor use drag and drop for their coding. App inventor has two coding screens, one for the 
    components and one for the actual code, while scratch has one.</p>
    
    <p>2. Design for mobile devices can put into account features that most computers don’t have, such as vibration and the 
    direction the phone is facing.</p>

    <a href= "https://repl.it/Miip/22">The Pot of Gold Repl</a>
    
    <h1>1.3.3 Branching and Output</h1>
    
    <p>1.  The if states that if a certain thing happens then the if will happen, the elif states that if any of this 
    certain things happen then to do what if will happen, and else states that if the if state doesn’t happen or isfalse 
    to do that else statement.</p>
    <p>2.  And, or, not, and not, or not, equals, greater than, less than, not equal,less than or equal, greater than 
    or equal are the ones we learned. Logical XOR is one from the internet.</p>
    <p>3.  They are all right because they would all help in a different way. </p>
    
    <h1>1.3.8</h1>
    
    <p>1. The sorting algorithm that is the fastest when it is nearly sorted is the insertion.</p>

    <p>2. The merge sorts will always finish at the same time.</p>

    <p>3. To find someones birthday it would take 8 tries when they tell you earlier or later.</p>

    <p>4. The unsorted list would take too long and would be possible but very slow.</p>

    <p>5. If google didn't keep its inventory of webpage content sorted then the list would get longer and would take 
    longer to sort.</p>
    
    <h1>1.3.10 Game Theory</h1>
    
    <p>1. When playing Rock, Paper, Scissors you make a guess on what they might do and try to beat them. Computer 
    simulations have helped out greatly with many companies. NASA uses this to test many different things to make sure it
    works before using it and risking the danger of someone.   </p>
    
    <p>2. Abstraction - the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. This could be useful for coding because you don't
    have to type out the whole code when you can just call the function.</p>
    
    <p>3. Using abstractions helped when you are using complex and long code and want to type the code multiple times. Instead of 
    typing it up more than one time you could just use abstractions. </p>
    
    <h1>1.4.2 Objects and Methods</h1>
    
    <p>1. An absolute path is a path that starts right from the root and a relative path, is a path starting from the Current 
    Directory of your program.</p>
    
    <p>2. An object can be a variable, a data structure, a function, or a method, and as such, is a location in memory having a value
    and referenced by an identifier</p>
    
    <p>3. A property is a special sort of class member and a method is a particular form of procedure for accomplishing or approaching 
    something.</p>
    
    <p>4.  The method does something to an object when called to one.</p>
    
    <h1>1.4.3 Arrays and Images</h1>
    
    <p>1. The data in a digital image contains a series of lists. If it has been altered that means someone has changedthe values in 
    the array</p>
    
    <p>2. They are different because a light sensitive camera captures an image by letting in light and and a digital camera works by
    letting the light in and a light detector turns the light rays in electric signals.</p>
    
    <p>3. a) Because like out of the way its like background usually, so its not important so changing it slightly doesn’t mean anything.</p>
    
    <p>b) Because of data compression</p>
    
    <p>c) It would be slightly oF</p>
    
    <p>4. It would look for RGB values that are similar to eachother within a certain boundaries.</p>
