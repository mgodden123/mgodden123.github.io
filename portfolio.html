    <h3>Blown to Bits Reflection</h3>
    <h1> <h1>I believe that computers will transform society. Eventually many people will have all of their information on the computer. Having this information on the computer can be very useful but also very dangerous. People would be able to access this information because it's on the computer. Social media is another way people are using the computers. They are posting information about their self and other and anyone will be able to access it. Having this information on the internet isn't safe no matter what you do to try to protect it. Having information on the internet can be very useful at times but can also be very dangerous since anyone can see it. But keeping information on paper can nice but also hard when you have too many papers to keep track of. !</h1>
    <h1>Lightbot Reflection</h1>
    <h1>The lightbot game works very similar to a computer. In the game you had different keys that made the object do things. We had to arrange the keys so that the object would do them in a certain order. So when using a keyboard and clicking a key it has an output to then show of on the computer. This is similar to the game. Also when searching something on the internet it would then pull up a website. Lightbot is different from a computer because all the game is showing is that an object can turn and move any direction. A computer has way more codes and loops then the Lightbot game. !</h1>
