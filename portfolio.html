    <h1>1.1.1 Blown to Bits Reflection</h1>
    
    <p>I believe that computers will transform society. Eventually many people will have all of their information on the computer. 
    Having this information on the computer can be very useful but also very dangerous. People would be able to access this information
    because it's on the computer. Social media is another way people are using the computers. There are posting information about their
    self and other and anyone will be able to access it. Having this information on the internet isn't safe no matter what you do to try 
    to protect it. Having information on the internet can be very useful at times but can also be very dangerous since anyone can see it. 
    But keeping information on paper can nice but also hard when you have too many papers to keep track of.</p>
    
    <h1>1.1.2 Lightbot Reflection</h1>
    
    <c><img src="images/lightbot.png" height="480"></c>
    
    <p>The lightbot game works very similar to a computer. In the game you had different keys that made the object do things. We had 
    to arrange the keys so that the object would do them in a certain order. So when using a keyboard and clicking a key it has an 
    output to then show of on the computer. This is similar to the game. Also when searching something on the internet it would then 
    pull up a website. Lightbot is different from a computer because all the game is showing is that an object can turn and move any 
    direction. A computer has way more codes and loops then the Lightbot game.</p>
    
    <h1>1.1.3 Scratch Branching</h1>

    <p>1. This is important because in case you mess up on a part of the code it would be easier to find the mistake in a 
    small part of code than a big section of code.</p> 
    <p>2. Making code is like having a schedule for the day it has everything you want to do on it and it follows a certain order.</p>  
    <p>3. It was nice working with a partner because it was a lot easier to not make a mistake. We could both be thinking
    of ideas while one person is working.</p> 
    <p>4. Whenever a page is open it will only be running that page. You could have twenty pages open but only be actually
    running one or two of them.</p> 
    
    <h1>1.1.4 Scratch Objects and Methods</h1>
    
    <c><iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="//scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/177946166/?autostart=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></c>
    
    <p>1. If more than one sprite out of hundreds made the same noise when one key was pressed it would be very hard to tell what 
    sprite is making a noise. It could also get very annoying with all of the sounds.</p>
    <p>2. Events are when a certain key is pressed it makes something happen and Handlers are when  a series of events happen
    when one button is pressed.</p>
    <p>a)The play G button is an action that happens when a sirtin key is pressed.</p>
    <p>b) It would be convenient to have the play G button allow more than one event to occur at the same time.</p> 
    
    <h1>1.1.5 Scratch “Accumulator” and “Aggregator”</h1>

    <c><iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="//scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/173644098/?autostart=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></c>

    <p>1.   The primary advantage of using a fixed value variable is that it can be easily change.</p>
    <p>2.   If you were entering a transaction and wanted to know the effectiveness than you can use a most recent
    variable to compare.</p>
    <p>3.   a)  Video games use an accumulator to keep track how many points you have earned. Also,  an online calculator
    uses the accumulator to add, subtract, divide, etc and gives you an answer.</p>  
    <p>b) In a video game, every time a certain goal is accomplished the score is changed. The computer keeps track of these 
    score changes and with the accumulator function gathers the total score.</p>
    <p>4.   The accumulator only holds on to one number while the aggregator holds on to a whole list.</p>
    
    <h1>1.1.6 Scratch One-Way Flag</h1>
    
    <c><iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="//scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/174282013/?autostart=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></c>
    
    <p>1. The Stepper counts down a list.
          The Walker displays the number on the list being selected by the Stepper.
          The Best-So-Far determines the highest number out of the numbers it's given. Used for a high score keeper.</p>
    <p>2. It would be great for almost any game where score matters. Maybe a platformer in which time is a factor. You 
          would be able to play multiple times and the game would track your fastest time.</p>
         
    <h1>1.1.7 Pac-Man</h1>
         
    <video controls>
    <c> src="file/pac man.mp4" type="video/mp4"</c>
    </video>
         
    <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/174861686/#editor">Pac-Man Link</a>
         
    <p>For our game my team made maze where one of the pieces had to make it to the end before a different piece would catch up
    to it and kill it. The piece you control is pac-man and the piece that is trying to kill you is a ghost. The main piece is
    coded so it can go through the color black and the maze is the color black. The ghost is coded to follow pac-man but its not
    coded so it cannot pass through the color black so it makes the game a bit more difficult. When you make it to the finish line
    a new page will come up saying “YOU WIN”.</p>
